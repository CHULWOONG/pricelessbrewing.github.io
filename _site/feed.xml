  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I use the same method that Brulosopher made popular to harvest yeast directly from your starter, and use Homebrewdads wonderful yeast starter calculator. Can’t promote his caculator enough, it really is great! Most of this should look familiar to you if you’ve read or used this process before but it bears repeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-1-finish-starter-fermentation&quot;&gt;Step 1: Finish Starter Fermentation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you leave enough time to complete the starter fermentation, typically 2 days then a day to cold crash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-2-harvesting&quot;&gt;Step 2: Harvesting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 30-48 hours, the starter is usually done. More time is actually detrimental to your yeast as it will deplete it’s reservoirs of nutrients in order to keep itself alive. At this time, I harvest my overbuilt yeast and save that for next time. To do this, I sanitize a clean mason jar, swirl the starter once or twice to ensure it’s homogenous, hold the stirbar in place with a magnet, and fill the jar with the calculated volume from Homebrewdads calculator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-3-cold-crashing&quot;&gt;Step 3: Cold Crashing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I harvest the yeast, I place the starter flask in the fridge covered by a sanitized piece of foil or a stopper if you have one. To be clear, this should not be air tight as the yeast will continue to produce gas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-4-pitch-away&quot;&gt;Step 4: Pitch Away&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should know what to do here. Either decant the liquid, and the suspended yeast, and pitch or pitch the whole thing. I usually decant and pitch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-5-using-harvested-yeast&quot;&gt;Step 5: Using Harvested Yeast&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just pretend it’s a fresh vial and do everything you’d do normally and enjoy the money, gas and time getting fresh yeast you just saved!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people still suggest washing the harvested yeast, or decanting the beer atop the harvested yeast. I’m not convinced that this is actually helpful, aside from the extra step it would require. &lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While I much prefer to harvest yeast from a starter, this is still a viable option of saving your yeast after a good clean fermentation. Note of caution to not using after fermentation where it was under excessively warm, under pitched, harsh environment, high OG, low nutrients etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sanitize-all-the-things&quot;&gt;Sanitize all the things.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is even more crucial than in brewing, as any contaminations will be extended due to the much longer storage time and will be continued through each generation and pitch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When fermentation is done, and I’m racking the beer from the primary fermentation vessel, I leave a little beer on the cake. This makes it easier to pour, as the cake loosens up in the remaining beer. The actual process I use is pretty simple, as I just do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-save-your-cake-in-three-easy-steps&quot;&gt;How to save your cake in three easy steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave some beer on cake. 
Swish to suspend the yeast.
Pour beer and suspended cake into a cleaned and sanitized container. 
Done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optional Steps to slightly clarify saved yeast slurry
(Optional) Leave single large container alone for a half hour to settle out the trub and hop matter.
(Optional)After heavy trub and hops settles, slowly pour the remiaing liquid and yeast into a smaller (but still sanitized) container so that the thick layer on the bottom of the large container remains behind. New smaller contains can be saved until your next brewday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-use-your-slurry&quot;&gt;To use your slurry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now I’m using the yeast pitch rate calculator on brewers friend and selecting the “yeast type” to be Slurry. Since I’d rather over pitch than under pitch, I enter 1B cells/ml. That means that in 1C of slurry, I have about 237B cells.  http://www.brewersfriend.com/yeast-pitch-rate-and-starter-calculator/&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now I’m sure you’ve been in the situation where you bought a vial of liquid yeast and were told it’s fine to pitch directly. This is true sometimes, and yes it will still make beer even in the worst of cases. However, it’s not a very good practice. Healthy yeast means better bear. The three things you can easily control are pitching rates, fermentation temperatures, and oxygenation of the wort. This post is my current process for making starters, feel free to leave any feedback or questions you have. I’m open to considering alternative processes, especially if they save me time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use homebrewdads wonderful yeast starter calculator, as it builds up your starter volume for you and accounts for harvesting yeast by cell count. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;starter-gear&quot;&gt;Starter Gear:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIY stir place, made from a 12V 120mm Antec tri-cool computer fan, 6V/12V DC power adapter, and some magnets I appropriated from work. 
My “Flask” is actually a kitchen jar for storing dried spaghetti noodles. It’s narrow, tall, and about 3.5L which is pretty much perfect for me. 
Stainless steel pots of various sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So onto the actually starter process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-1-add-dme&quot;&gt;Step 1: Add DME&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the above mentioned calculator, HBDC since I’m lazy, to determine how much DME you need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-2-add-water-to-flaskpot&quot;&gt;Step 2: Add Water to Flask/Pot&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don’t use a flask I can boil in, and direct fire, I use a stainless steel pot. Which one depends on the size of the starter needed, but it’s usually a 1G/4L pot. With that said, add hot water to the mini-brew kettle and mix to dissolve the DME until you’re at the volume dictated by the HBDC. Note that this volume is NOT the volume of the liquid, but the volume of the DME + the liquid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-3-boil&quot;&gt;Step 3: Boil&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually only boil for about ten minutes. Make sure you don’t have a boil over, as they are very easy to do in a flask due to the narrow mouth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-4-cool&quot;&gt;Step 4: Cool&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the bol you have to cool the flask/pot before you can pitch. For flasks resistant to thermal shock, this means you can place it in a cold water bath. For my pot, this means I usually just put the lid on it and come back later. When I absolutely need to speed things up, I’ll place the pot in another pot filled with ice water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-5-pitch&quot;&gt;Step 5: Pitch.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the wort is cooled to the warm side of pitching temp, 70F is a fair standard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-6-start-your--starters&quot;&gt;Step 6: Start your … Starters&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the flask, or in my case spaghetti jar thing, on your stir plate and let it go for a about 36 hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-7-cold-crash&quot;&gt;Step 7: Cold Crash&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After your starter is done fermenting, let it crash in the fridge, covered by a sanitized piece of foil/lid/stopper until brewday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-8-pitch&quot;&gt;Step 8: Pitch&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove the starter from the fridge a few hours before you pitch so that it warms up to room temp. I then decant most of the liquid on top, leaving about two cups and the yeast cake. Swirl the flask/jar and pitch the remaining yeast slurry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the healthy fermentation, and make sure you have enough headspace/blowoff tube! If you haven’t been pitching the necessary cell counts, then this may be more vigorous than you’re used to. &lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hoping to make this easier for new brewers, and wanted to clarify a couple things about my Calculator which can be found at the top of this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going from Top to bottom, and left to right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Default BIAB values for my equipment.
    Default BIAB values for my equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-your-details&quot;&gt;Enter your details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;batch-size-gallons&quot;&gt;Batch Size Gallons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the volume into the fermenter, and will equal Post boil volume once chilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grain-bill-in-lb&quot;&gt;Grain Bill in Lb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total weight of all grains, exclude any additional sugar adjuncts (table, sucrose, corn, belgian candy etc) added during the boil&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hop-bill-in-oz&quot;&gt;Hop Bill in Oz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now this is the total amount of all hops in any form. Pellet, dry, or wet, doesn’t matter.
    If I can find the requisite data, I would like to seperate these as they absorb different amounts of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;length-of-boil-in-mins&quot;&gt;Length of Boil in Min(s)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;boil-off-rate-galhr&quot;&gt;Boil-Off Rate (Gal/Hr)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self Evident. I highly recommend you do a test boil, measuring your starting water volume and temp, and your final water volume and temp. I’m going to make another little calculator to figure out your boil off rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grain-temp-in-fahrenheit-for-imperial-and-celsius-for-metric&quot;&gt;Grain Temp in Fahrenheit for Imperial, and Celsius for Metric&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important, I know I’ve been guilty of not checking it but it can change your mash temp about a half degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mash-temp-in-fahrenheit-for-imperial-and-celsius-for-metric&quot;&gt;Mash Temp in Fahrenheit for Imperial, and Celsius for Metric&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your mash temp, after dough in, and mixing thoroughly. If different locations have different temps, you haven’t stirred enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sparging-volume-in-gallons&quot;&gt;Sparging Volume in Gallons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amount of water you’re sparging with, at 68F, This can either be batch sparge, dunk sparge, or pour over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-big-is-your-kettlemashtun-gallons&quot;&gt;How Big is your Kettle/Mashtun? (Gallons)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maximum volume of your mash tun if mash in a bag, or Brew kettle if BIAB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-wide-is-your-kettlemashtun-inches&quot;&gt;How Wide is your Kettle/Mashtun? (Inches)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diameter of your brew kettle, used for determining water volume heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trub-loss-gallons&quot;&gt;Trub Loss (Gallons)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trub loss is currently trub loss from brew kettle after chilling, and before racking to fermenter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grain-absorption-gallonslb&quot;&gt;Grain Absorption (Gallons/Lb)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much water your grain absorps, and does not release from squeeze/sparging.
Hard Squeeze is the default, you may get very close if allowed to drain naturally and suspended.
If allowing to drain in a bucket with no self pressure from suspending the bag I recommend 0.1
If doing traditional mashing in a cooler, and not squeezing or allowing the bag to drain I recommend 0.125.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hop-absorption-gallonsoz&quot;&gt;Hop Absorption (Gallons/oz)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amount of wort your hops absorb. This absorption rate was cited for dry leaf hops, I know pellets and wet will be slightly different, but haven’t found a credible source for them yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-results&quot;&gt;General Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.21 Gallons
15.350 Inches high
Desired pre boil volume, at boil temp. If different and you trust your boil off rate, boil down to this volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maximum Mash thickness determined from your grain bill, batch size, losses, and pot size. Would recommend keeping Mash Volume .5 gallons below Pot size, for ease of dough in, stirring, and to keep any potential &lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I bought two of these heat sticks from amazon last week for 6.78 each, and have cut over 45 minutes off my brew day when using just one of them. About an hour cut off of my brew day using both. This is mostly due to a stove top that while able to boil 6 gallons, it takes far too long to get there on it’s own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00FO8FY68?pc_redir=1413886912&amp;amp;robot_redir=1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;heating-times&quot;&gt;Heating times:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 140F tap water to a rolling boil it took my stovetop about an hour and a half. With one heatstick, in additon to the stovetop, I went from 70F tap water to boil in 36 minutes! I also timed to strike temp, 70F to 170F in 16 minutes! That’s faster than my propane burner was, and a lot cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a single heat stick to speed up the heating times, I completed a brew day in 3.5 hours. A half hour of that was spent dealing with draining and sparging the sparge buckets then I had to boil down .4 gallons after the 60 minute boil and that added about 20 minutes. So using both heat sticks, no chill, and a no sparge full volume mash I might be able to complete my next brew day in under 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-use-and-a-word-of-warning&quot;&gt;First use and a word of warning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are two things to remember when dealing with these psuedo heat sticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) These must ALWAYS be used on a GFCI protected circuit, one per heat stick. NO doubling up, no using with appliances. These must be dedicated and separate all by themselves. Moreover, 1 outlet does NOT mean one circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Submerge before plugging in, and do not remove from the liquid without unplugging and waiting a bit to allow the  stick to cool. Failure to do either of these things risks failure and breaking the heating elements one time fuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;images\HeatStick.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images\HeatStick.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;\images\HeatStick.jpg&quot; title=&quot;The top is slightly gray, this is what it should look like after boiling in water for an hour. The bottom has a much darker color, I had to boil the wort down a little after the typical 60 minutes as I was .4 gallons too high :(.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Run it in water for an hour, and allow to cool. The fake chrome will burn off, exposing the aluminum heating element and developing a layer of passive aluminum oxide. When you pull it out the stick should be a dark gray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Do not expose to cleaning, or sanitizing agents. You don’t need to, and it’ll ruin the passive patina layer on the aluminum. No PBW, oxyclean, starsan, iodophor, bleach etc. Just wash it off when you’re done and dry off. It’s used in the pre-boil side anyway so no need to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing, I would recommend measuring your boil off again with these, as you can create local hot spots in the water before a real boil is reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recommendation&quot;&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all I’m very happy I bought these up. However at the current price ($18~) I would be more inclined to build one instead.  At the original price they were amazing, cutting my time down significantly each brew day for very little money. My current recommendation is to buy at least one of these once the price drops down again, if you use an amazon price tracking service it’ll alert you when the price drops back down to a reasonable amount.&lt;/p&gt;
