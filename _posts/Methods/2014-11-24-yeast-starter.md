Placeholder for how I make yeast starters, starting with Homebrewdads wonderful yeast calculator. 

I use homebrewdads wonderful yeast starter calculator, as it builds up your starter volume for you and accounts for harvesting yeast by cell count. 

# Starter Gear:
DIY stir place, made from a 12V 120mm Antec tri-cool computer fan, 6V/12V DC power adapter, and some magnets I appropriated from work.
